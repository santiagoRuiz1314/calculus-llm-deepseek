        "solution": "To find the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin(x))/x:\n\nThis is a famous limit that equals 1.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. As x approaches 0, both sin(x) and x approach 0, giving us the indeterminate form 0/0.\n\n2. We can evaluate this limit using L'Hôpital's rule:\n   lim(x→0) (sin(x))/x = lim(x→0) (cos(x))/1 = cos(0) = 1\n\n3. Alternatively, we can use the Taylor series expansion of sin(x):\n   sin(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - ... ≈ x as x approaches 0\n   So, (sin(x))/x ≈ x/x = 1 as x approaches 0\n\nFinal answer: lim(x→0) (sin(x))/x = 1"
